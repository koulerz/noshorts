# NoShorts

[NoShorts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noshorts/jfmjlacbhjnneepbohbiijicffbbebbk) is a Chrome extension. It categorizes your subscribed videos.

It adds tabs to the YouTube subscriptions page, putting different types of videos in their own tabs. This makes it easier to browse and view. Avoid too many shorts videos on the subscriptions page.

[NoShorts](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/noshorts/jfmjlacbhjnneepbohbiijicffbbebbk) only works on your youtube subscription page. If you don't want to see shorts video recommendations on the YouTube homepage or the other pages, you can try to select the [Not interested] button on the shorts video. Youtube will reduce or no longer recommend shorts videos for you.
